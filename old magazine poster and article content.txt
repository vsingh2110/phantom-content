Phantom Healthcare strives to provide professional support with quality services that are custom fit to the needs of today’s growing healthcare industry. We aim to develop long-term relationships with our clients and do our best to keep Imaging equipment up-to-date and working like new.

In the dynamic world of healthcare, technological advancements are crucial in improving patient care and diagnostic accuracy. Radiology, a cornerstone of medical imaging, relies heavily on cutting-edge equipment to provide healthcare professionals with the tools they need for accurate diagnoses. However, the high cost of acquiring new radiology equipment can be a significant barrier for many healthcare facilities. This is where refurbished radiology equipment emerges as a cost-effective and sustainable solution.

Small & medium-sized hospitals, typically doctor-owned and with less than 100 beds, often cannot afford to buy new high-end equipment. These facilities prefer refurbished equipment of reputed brands that will cost less but perform well for a few years without complaints. These could be young doctors who become self-employed after using such devices in large hospitals. 




An Open Letter to Future Women Leaders in Healthcare
“By Rochi Nargotra (CEO & Managing Director) & Brijesh Suneja (Managing Director), Phantom Healthcare”
Dear Future Women Leaders,
As we stand at the helm of Phantom Healthcare, we are honored to witness and contribute to the transformation of the healthcare industry. Women have always played an integral role in medicine, research, and innovation, yet leadership representation remains a work in progress. To the next generation of women in healthcare, we say this: your time is now.
Breaking Barriers & Overcoming Bias
Healthcare leadership has long been a space where gender biases have created roadblocks, but these are challenges that can—and must—be overcome. We have seen firsthand how knowledge, determination, and unwavering commitment break through these barriers. Women leaders are reshaping diagnostics, leading groundbreaking research, and driving innovations that impact millions of lives.
At Phantom Healthcare, we firmly believe in equal opportunity, skill-based leadership, and fostering an inclusive work culture where merit determines success. We encourage women to step forward, take on leadership roles, and be the changemakers the industry needs.

— Rochi Nargotra, CEO & Managing Director, Phantom Healthcare


The Power of Leadership & Mentorship
Leadership is not about position—it is about influence, responsibility, and vision. Throughout our journey, we have seen how mentorship plays a vital role in shaping future leaders. Strong mentorship and support networks provide women with the tools and confidence to take on greater challenges.
For aspiring women in healthcare, our message is simple: Seek mentors, build your network, and never hesitate to step into leadership roles. Likewise, when you reach a position of influence, become a mentor, uplift others, and create pathways for more women to rise.
Balancing Career & Personal Life
Work-life balance is often seen as a major challenge for women in leadership. We understand that balancing career aspirations, family responsibilities, and personal well-being can be demanding. However, we also believe that with strong workplace policies, flexible environments, and supportive ecosystems, women can thrive in both their personal and professional lives.
At Phantom Healthcare, we advocate for workplaces that foster balance—where ambition and well-being go hand in hand. The key is not perfection, but prioritization and self-belief.

Bridging the Diagnostic Divide: Transforming Healthcare in Tier 2 and Tier 3 Cities


Brijesh Suneja (Managing Director)
Phantom Healthcare

India’s tier 2 and tier 3 cities are undergoing a significant transformation in healthcare, particularly in the field of diagnostics. Historically, these regions have faced considerable challenges, including limited access to advanced diagnostic infrastructure, a shortage of trained professionals, and low awareness about the importance of preventive healthcare. However, recent developments are paving the way for improved access, though challenges persist.
The Current State of Diagnostics Infrastructure
Diagnostic facilities in tier 2 and 3 cities have traditionally relied on basic setups, often equipped with outdated technology. Advanced diagnostic tools such as MRI, CT, and PET-CT scanners remain scarce, leading to a reliance on urban centers for comprehensive diagnostic services. This not only delays critical care but also places a financial burden on patients traveling long distances. Additionally, high patient volumes in these limited facilities contribute to longer wait times, reducing the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery.
Technology Adoption: Breaking Barriers
Technology is emerging as a game-changer in bridging geographical barriers. Tele-diagnostics, for example, allows healthcare providers to share imaging results and collaborate with specialists in urban centers, ensuring timely diagnosis for patients in remote locations. AI-powered tools are further enhancing diagnostic accuracy and speeding up the interpretation of imaging results.
Mobile diagnostic units are also making strides in extending the reach of diagnostic services. These units bring imaging equipment directly to underserved areas, providing on-the-spot testing and reporting. Additionally, cloud-based data storage systems facilitate seamless communication between diagnostic centers in smaller towns and expert radiologists in metro cities, enabling faster decision-making and treatment planning.
The Role of Public-Private Partnerships
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are playing a critical role in transforming diagnostics in tier 2 and 3 cities. Government initiatives like Ayushman Bharat are partnering with private healthcare providers to establish diagnostic centers in underserved areas. These collaborations leverage the expertise of private entities while utilizing government support to expand access.
Refurbished radiology equipment has become an essential component of this growth, offering a cost-effective alternative to new machines. By integrating refurbished equipment into diagnostic facilities, healthcare providers can deliver high-quality services without the financial strain of acquiring new systems.
Building a Skilled Workforce
A robust diagnostics infrastructure requires a skilled workforce, and training programs are addressing this need. Dedicated centers are being established to train lab technicians, radiology technologists, and biomedical engineers. Online certification programs and tele-education platforms are further empowering professionals in remote locations, ensuring they are equipped to operate advanced equipment and provide high-quality care.
Incentives to retain skilled professionals in smaller cities are also crucial. Collaborative efforts between the government and private sector are creating opportunities for these professionals to grow their careers while addressing the healthcare needs of tier 2 and 3 cities.
Challenges, Opportunities, and the Way Forward
While progress is evident, challenges remain. High costs of diagnostic equipment, difficulty in retaining skilled professionals, and low awareness about preventive diagnostics continue to hinder growth. However, opportunities abound. The increasing affordability of refurbished equipment, growing awareness of healthcare needs, and the potential of technology to address access gaps are paving the way for a brighter future.
To truly transform diagnostics in tier 2 and 3 cities, the focus must be on scaling infrastructure, promoting public-private collaborations, and investing in education and awareness campaigns. Sustainable solutions, such as leveraging refurbished radiology equipment, can help expand diagnostic capabilities rapidly without overburdening healthcare budgets.



In conclusion, the journey to transform diagnostics in India’s tier 2 and 3 cities is both challenging and promising. By embracing innovation, fostering collaboration, and investing in people and technology, we can ensure that quality healthcare reaches every corner of the nation.
